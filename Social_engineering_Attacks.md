# SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS IN THE DIGITAL AGE

## ABSTRACT
Social engineering attacks are one of the most dangerous cyber threats in the digital age.
Instead of targeting computer systems directly, attackers manipulate human behavior to gain
unauthorized access to sensitive information. This seminar discusses the concept of social
engineering, its types, real-world examples, impacts, and preventive measures.

## INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of the internet and digital technologies, cyber crimes have also
increased. Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology such as trust, fear, curiosity,
and urgency. These attacks are commonly carried out through emails, phone calls, social media,
and fake websites.

## WHAT IS SOCIAL ENGINEERING?
Social engineering is a technique used by attackers to deceive individuals into revealing
confidential information such as passwords, OTPs, bank details, or personal data.

## TYPES OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS
### 1. Phishing
Fake emails or messages that appear to be from trusted sources to steal sensitive information.

### 2. Vishing
Voice-based attacks where scammers call victims pretending to be bank officials or authorities.

### 3. Smishing
SMS-based attacks that trick users into clicking malicious links.

### 4. Pretexting
Attackers create a fake scenario to gain the victim’s trust and extract information.

### 5. Baiting
Offering free downloads or gifts to lure victims into malware attacks.

## IMPACT OF SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS
- Financial loss
- Identity theft
- Data breaches
- Loss of reputation
- Psychological stress

## PREVENTION METHODS
- Do not share personal or financial information
- Verify emails, calls, and messages
- Use strong passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Educate users about cyber security threats

## CONCLUSION
Social engineering attacks target the weakest link in cyber security – humans. Awareness,
education, and cautious behavior are the best defenses against these attacks in the digital age.
